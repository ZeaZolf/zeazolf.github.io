<h1>The Return (hopefully)</h1>
<h2>10/12/2025, 10:45 PM | by Rose</h2>
<p>After around 4 months without doing anything with this website, I have came back to it and hopefully will work on it some more.</p>
<p>What I've done so far:</p>

<p>Removed images from the footer (was nothing wrong aside from not fitting in with the style in my opinion, and a footer issue)</p>
<p>Began doing updates in form of their own special page (like this one!)</p>

<p>What is planned:</p>
<p>Fix footer issue with overlapping (for example, the images I used to have on my footer overlapped with content on my Framework 13)</p>
<p>Get new icons for the main page</p>

<p>~ Rose</p>
<div class="footer">

    <a href="../../main.html">return to sanity</a>
    <p>now I'm nothing</p>
